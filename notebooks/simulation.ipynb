    "#### Object Oriented Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing data organization is critical for efficient handling of Monte Carlo iterations and stochastic modeling. We want to balance structure with memory and computational efficiency. I have decided to take an object oriented approach, breaking down the simulation task into the following classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simulation**: Handles the iterations of the Monte Carlo simulation along with aggregating the results from each game simulation.\n",
    "- **Game**: Handles the game context for a single game simulation - clock, posession, team fouls, timeouts, etc.\n",
    "- **PlayerGameState**: Handles the *mutable* in-game stats for a player - points, assists, rebounds, personal fouls, etc.\n",
    "- **PlayerProfile**: Handles the *immutable* historical data retrieved from a database at the start of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The separation of the mutable data from the immutable data is crutial for minimizing the memory required to run thousands of simulations of the same game. Here, a player profile will be generated once at the start of the simulation. Empty PlayerGameState objects will be initilized for tracking in-game stats and reference the same player profile objects afor any read-only data required from the player. This approach allows the Player profiles to be established only once, instead of requiring deep copies or clones to create new player profiles for each simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulating a Possession\n",
    "\n",
    "A baseketball posession can be broken into a series of decisions that make up a decision tree. Some of these decisions are offensively oriented (shot taken), defensive oriented (foul before shot), or require interactions between both (rebounds).\n",
    "\n",
    "We start each possession under the assumption that two things can happen: Offense attempts to run a play or Defense commits a foul to prevent that play from executing. We categorize this differently from a foul that occurs during the play execution (shooting foul)."
